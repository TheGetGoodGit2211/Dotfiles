And to clarify the sound/mic situation if I wanna record anything I have an audio interface and studio mic my older brother gave me as a hand-me-down (though it's missing the pop filter) so that's my mic and also I'm using my Alexa as a bluetooth speaker whenever I'm not using headphones. Also if you think something is in the future it's probably not. It's start of November 2025 now and your knowledge cutoff is obviously before that. Anything that got a confirmed or rumored release date of any time before Nov 2025 HAS been released. Think long and hard cause I'd like your thoughts on each component and peripheral choice. And so you have these for context I'll tell you my soon-to-be speakers are the Creative Pebble V3 with my mic being the FIFINE USB Gaming Microphone Kit (AKA the A6T, that other name was just the keyword-bloated Amazon listing). And to quell any worries about my budget cooling choiced I looked at and considered the TDP when purchasing and did my research in that aspect. Also I did some GPU and CPU benchmarks as well as some real world stress testing with Minecraft, DOOM, and AI workloads (if interested, a 20B model with 35 of a total 48 layers GPU-offloaded with Flash Attention on at 16000 context tokens, and it somehow managed to fit entirely into VRAM and run a little faster than I can read lol), and honestly under every one of those tests the 9800X3D got nowhere near it's max temp of 95 degrees and never even thermal throttled and rthe GPU I'm pretty sure stayed under 50 degrees tho I can double check. I also imagine the power supply will raise an eyebrow, especially being a  Gigabyte one. But I don't believe it's from a model series that had the infamous issues and it's been working fine for me for a good couple weeks now. And usually if a power supply fails it's a capacitor going which protects the other components from getting fried and even then the parts all come with manufacturer warranty.

One of the cheapest at all on CCL actually and I'm typing to you on it rn and it feels pretty damn good. Also I will use up the stock thermal paste before moving to the more premium stuff cause it's only 4g a syringe and every gram counts. And about the studio mic, it does sound pretty good but the loss of the pop filter and the amount of noise it lets in turn me off and it's also the kind of mic you hold in one hand rather than have on a s tand a few inches to the side of your face hence why the studio mic + interface is temporary. One final note that some of these prices being well below MSRP is cause I caught some good sales on CCL when I bought the components.","recorded":"2025-11-03 00:59:38.079721532","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"I build a fantastic budget gaming PC a couple weeks ago so I'll tell you the full build and you can do a lil research and tell me what you think.

What if Palpatine actually cared about Vader and others he, in canon, merely pretended to have connections with? Perhaps the call to kill Dooku was not a test of Anakin's rage but of his restrains, and Dooku's death so happened to leave him saddened internally. And then when that same recklessness deprives him of his limbs and much of his skin on Mustafar he's annoyed but empathetic. \"Vader, you fool! How are you to save those you care about when you can't see past your own rage? Listen closely, boy. You must learn to channel your anger, not let it consume you.\" And then maybe this timeline also has Palpatine genuinely not know Maul was alive until when they meet again in the clone wars and he was forced to fight his favourite assassin and their brother. And he killed Savage as a tragic act of self-defense and kept maul locked up for his own safety. But then later, after the rise of the Empire, Palpatine hears of Maul's death on Tatooine to Jedi traitor Obi-Wan Kenobi and laments not having intervened sooner to save his prodigal son. And in this timeline, Palpatine would act with true compassion. He would help Vader try to persuade Ahsoka and he would invite Vader to senate meetings to give his own views on things and learn the politics of power. Vader would disagree with Palps on some things - minor things like governance details and little tax code changes here and there - but on certain things they would come to an agreement after a lively debate on Vader's flagship over a nice glass of expensive Coruscanti whiskey. This would be stuff like stopping Imperial corruption, getting the people more involved, even re-evaluating Tarkin's methods through data-driven analysis only to ultimately find it ineffective and leading to Death Star resources instead being spent on the welfare state and a modernized, well armed, and well structured military meant to ensure safety rather than instill fear. Vader's suit would also be built for comfort and strength. I also believe this Palpatine would see order 66 as an overreaction after the fact, and issue a public apology to those willing to join his Empire as the Imperial Peacekeeping Corps, led by Grandmaster Vader. Palpatine would've also had Anakin protect and take the Younglings rather than killing them. As for the rebellion, it has no reason to form. Each day the Empire becomes less and less corrupt with a stronger and stronger welfare state building based mostly on Vader's ideas. After all, what would Palpatine know about being poor when he's... well, a Palpatine? Best to leave that kind of stuff to Vader and others who have faced hardship and discrimination. Like Thrawn, for example. The Rebellion collapses before it ever unites and the galaxy find a quickly improving order under the Emperor and Co-Emperor, and the senate remains as an advisory council rather than a direct voting body, with Palpatine ensuring that specifically his political rivals from the old days are fairly treated. Overall Vader becomes a moral grounding for Palpatine as both try to give Imperial citizens the best lives possible. In fact, the Hutts and other gangs and organizations are eliminated throughout the galaxy on who else but Vader's orders and with Palpatine's backing. Ideologically, Palpatine's arrogance here isn't just in the idea that's he's the Sith'ari who will bring lasting order and peace to the galaxy the way Vitiate and certainly Bane never could but also in the idea that he has cracked the Sith code and philosophy by refusing to remain stagnant in old traditions as those from the Bane lineage have. Palpatine's willingness here to make amends with enemies and view compassion as an extension of the very attachments and drive that give the Sith their strength that the Jedi fear is seen by him as the true and only doctrine of the Sith. Palpatine might even look to Dart Vectivus, the infamous good Sith who started his journey into the Dark Side by removing miners working for him from an asteroid strong in the Dark Side that was negatively effecting them, for inspiration.

But pywal generated no .fish for me to simply execute and also I'm not sure if fisher has any theme that could like dynamically load the colors for me or anything.","recorded":"2025-11-02 20:18:41.535649266","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"functions -f fish_prompt\n","recorded":"2025-11-02 20:10:08.083779993","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"# set fish_color_normal normal\nset fish_color_normal {foreground.strip}\n# set fish_color_command 005fd7\nset fish_color_command {color2.strip}\n# set fish_color_param 00afff\nset fish_color_param {color1.strip}\n# set fish_color_redirection 00afff\nset fish_color_redirection $fish_color_param\n# set fish_color_comment 990000\nset fish_color_comment {color8.strip}\nset fish_color_error ff0000\n# set fish_color_escape 00a6b2\nset fish_color_escape {color5.strip}\n# set fish_color_operator 00a6b2\nset fish_color_operator $fish_color_escape\nset fish_color_end {color4.strip}\nset fish_color_quote {color6.strip}\nset fish_color_autosuggestion 555 brblack\nset fish_color_user brgreen\n# set fish_color_host normal\nset fish_color_host $fish_color_normal\nset fish_color_valid_path --underline\nset fish_color_cwd green\nset fish_color_cwd_root red\nset fish_color_match --background=brblue\nset fish_color_search_match bryellow --background=brblack\nset fish_color_selection white --bold --background=brblack\nset fish_color_cancel -r\nset fish_pager_color_prefix white --bold --underline\nset fish_pager_color_completion\n# set fish_pager_color_description B3A06D yellow\nset fish_pager_color_description $fish_color_quote yellow\nset fish_pager_color_progress brwhite --background=cyan\nset fish_color_history_current --bold","recorded":"2025-11-02 20:06:12.035848575","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"function fish_prompt\n    set -l last_status $status\n\n    if set -q CONDA_LEFT_PROMPT\n        __conda_add_prompt\n    end\n\n    if set -q HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE\n        # Use wal colors\n        set -l COLOR_USER $COLOR_13   # blue\n        set -l COLOR_DIR $COLOR_12    # orange\n        set -l COLOR_GIT $COLOR_14    # purple\n        set -l COLOR_SUCCESS $COLOR_7 # light blue\n        set -l COLOR_FAIL $COLOR_10   # red\n\n        # Example: print username@host manually\n        echo -n (set_color $COLOR_USER)(whoami)'@'(hostname) ' '\n        echo -n (set_color $COLOR_DIR)(prompt_pwd) ' '\n        \n        # Git branch can go here if you want\n        # echo -n (set_color $COLOR_GIT)(git_prompt_info) ' '\n        \n        # Last command status\n        if test $last_status -ne 0\n            echo -n (set_color $COLOR_FAIL) '✗ '\n        else\n            echo -n (set_color $COLOR_SUCCESS) '✔ '\n        end\n\n        # Prompt symbol\n        echo -n (set_color $COLOR_SUCCESS)'❯ ' (set_color normal)\n    else\n        # Regular Fisher prompt\n        return_last_status $last_status\n        __fish_prompt_orig\n    end\nend\n","recorded":"2025-11-02 19:59:47.22294872","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"# Defined via `source`\nfunction fish_prompt\n    set -l last_status $status\n    if set -q CONDA_LEFT_PROMPT\n        __conda_add_prompt\n    end\n    return_last_status $last_status\n    __fish_prompt_orig\nend","recorded":"2025-11-02 19:58:59.646355362","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"/* CSS variables\n   Generated by 'wal' */\n:root {\n    --wallpaper: url(\"/home/drakcoder/Documents/wallpapers/vader_conflicted.jpg\");\n\n    /* Special */\n    --background: #0E0D13;\n    --foreground: #8cc5e4;\n    --cursor: #8cc5e4;\n\n    /* Colors */\n    --color0: #0E0D13;\n    --color1: #9D111B;\n    --color2: #DD191E;\n    --color3: #DE5843;\n    --color4: #F7974D;\n    --color5: #225EA3;\n    --color6: #AA678D;\n    --color7: #8cc5e4;\n    --color8: #62899f;\n    --color9: #9D111B;\n    --color10: #DD191E;\n    --color11: #DE5843;\n    --color12: #F7974D;\n    --color13: #225EA3;\n    --color14: #AA678D;\n    --color15: #8cc5e4;\n}","recorded":"2025-11-02 19:57:56.53740008","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"ok so here's the thing i'm using fisher for my shell color scheme and anything i type and also the stuff theat comes before the stuff I trype (the 'username@machine-name' and etc etc) stay the set colorscheme i set with fisher.
